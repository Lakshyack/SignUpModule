Full-Stack Mini Project

This repository contains my first full-stack mini project, where I've implemented various technologies for both the frontend and backend.
Technologies Used
Frontend

    HTML
    CSS
    Bootstrap

Backend

    Java Servlet
    JSP (JavaServer Pages)

Database

    MySQL

Project Overview

This project consists of three main web pages:

    Landing Page
    Login Page
    Signup Page

I didn't incorporate JavaScript in this project due to my limited knowledge of the language. However, I plan to integrate JavaScript into my next project.
How to Run

To run the project, follow these steps:

    Ensure you have a MySQL database set up.
    Deploy the Java Servlet and JSP files to your server environment.
    Configure the database connection in the backend code.
    Access the landing page to navigate through the application.
    Follow the on-screen instructions to log in and explore the functionality.

Note

This project serves as a learning exercise and may contain limitations and areas for improvement. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
